# Task-Tracker
First, I set up the HTML structure. 
In the head section, you include meta tags for character encoding, compatibility, and viewport settings, along with a title for the page. I linked my external CSS file to style the task tracker. 
Inside the body section, I structured the task tracker layout using header, main, and section tags. The header contains a title and a form for adding new tasks. 
The main section includes a task list container with a heading and a placeholder for tasks. I defined the styling for various elements in the linked style.css file. 
The CSS styles handle the visual appearance of the task tracker, including colors, fonts, padding, and margins. 
Finally, I added JavaScript code to handle the interactivity. The script listens for the page load event and registers an event listener on the form submit event.
When a new task is submitted, the script creates the necessary HTML elements dynamically, sets their attributes and values, and appends them to the task list container. 
Event listeners are also added to handle editing and deleting tasks.
